# WP Client Portal
A test project to learn myself NuxtJS. The project uses a mix of Wordpress REST and the Clickup API. This portal is a fun-project to store all of my clients data in the same place.

### Functions & How It Works
- Auth through Wordpress REST API (user management in Wordpress)
- Client Data stored through a Wordpress back-end
- Invoice data setup through the app and stored to the Wordpress back-end
- Todo lists managed through ClickUp
- Deadlines managed through Clickup

### Used Packages

- Nuxtjs (vuex, vue-router, Axios, ...)
- node-sass & sass-loader

# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
